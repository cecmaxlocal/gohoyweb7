## 📜 About The Project

`gohoyweb7` is an integrated environment designed to streamline the entire programming lifecycle. At its core is the **Locust IDE**, a lightweight but powerful editor optimized for script files and multi-platform development.

The project follows the **"Shrimp Bean Ball"** philosophy: combining small, independent components (like shrimp and beans) into a cohesive, powerful, and functional whole (the ball).

### Key Features

*   **Integrated Editor**: The Locust IDE provides syntax highlighting, debugging, and script execution.
*   **Multi-Platform**: A single codebase manages components for the **Web**, **Desktop Client**, and backend **Servers**.
*   **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns between different parts of the application (`App`, `Client`, `Servers`).
*   **Scripting Power**: Designed from the ground up to support rapid development and automation through script files.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need Node.js, Go, and potentially other dependencies depending on the module you are working with.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/gohoyweb7.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd gohoyweb7
    ```
3.  Install dependencies for each module as needed:
    ```sh
    # For the Web/Client components
    cd Client && npm install
    
    # For the server
    cd ../Servers && go mod tidy
    ```

## 💻 Usage

Run each component from its respective directory.

*   **To run the Web server:**
    ```sh
    cd Web
    # (Use a simple live server or your preferred tool)
    ```
*   **To run the backend Go servers:**
    ```sh
    cd Servers
    go run main.go
    ```
*   **To launch the Desktop application:**
    ```sh
    cd Desktop
    # (Instructions for running your Electron/Tauri app)
    ```
